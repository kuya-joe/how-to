## how-to for setting things up

This is a guide to set things up on a dev machine

### How to save your code for running locally

Create a branch `localdev` and commit to that. Create a [git tag](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging) to track those commits that you made that should not be pushed. 

**NEVER push this `localdev` branch**
